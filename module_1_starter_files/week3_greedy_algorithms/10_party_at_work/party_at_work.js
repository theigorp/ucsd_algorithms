  PROBLEM STATEMENT:
  Find a maximum independent set in a tree.
  Input: 
    A tree representing the hierarchical structure of a company, where each edge connects a person with her/his immediate boss.

    bosses are around, she decides not to invite a person if her/his immediate boss is invited.
  Output:
    A maximum independent set of nodes in this tree, i.e., a node-set where every two nodes are not adjacent (the maximum
    number of people at the party).
